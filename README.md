Welcome to the introduction of SAT course. I'm your instructor Eric. Here's some my background might intrigue you. I graduated from University of Washington, Seattle with a Bachelor of Science in Biologicial science with a minor in Applied Math and another minor in Music - becuase i like classical music and me, myself play classical guitar. I was, and still, yes, a member of Seattle Classical Guitar Society and played dual with our department chair Professor David Baker who is one of the best Biochemist in this wrold i believe. He is real popular and on the science news evereywhere. I also have a master degree in bioinformatics from Northeastern University. Prior to relocate back to Shanghai, I was a research bioinformatics scientist at Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle. Besides research and classical music, i like outdoor sports: hiking, kayaking, camping and snow-boarding. Yeah, unfortunately, there are not too many this kind of activities here in China.

Please find the course supporting materials on this course site. At meantime, i'm working on my own canvas page so hopefully it could be up by next wednesday. Otherwise, we could stick with this course page if you feel like this works better.

Normally, i would update and upload the materials for the class ahead of time so that you could fully use your free time to study ACT on your own pace.

Do make sure you would finish your assignment on time and bring questions and thoughts to the class period.

Here's the Syllabus and covered topics for you. And i will post the anouncement and daily assignment on the course Wiki.

**SAT READING RESOURCES** 

#Timing

SAT Reading is made up of two to three 20-25 minute sections, depending on which subject is unscored.  Pacing for SAT Reading can be a little more complicated than for other sections since there are passages to read.  Some people only feel comfortable answering the questions on a passage if they have read the whole thing; however, for many people, time constraints won’t allow them to both read the whole passage and answer all the questions.  If you find that time is an issue for you, first just read the opening and closing paragraphs, which usually contain the main idea, and perhaps skim the middle.  Then read the questions and go back into the passage knowing what you are looking for.  Try out a few different approaches to passage-based reading.  Ultimately, the right way to do it is the way that works best for you.

#Format

The two question types on SAT Reading are sentence completion and passage-based reading.  Both are standard multiple-choice.

**Sentence Completion**: You will have to choose the word or words (two) that best complete the sentence.  Unless you are a vocabulary genius, there are probably going to be some words on the test that you don’t know, so learn some strategies to up your chances of answering correctly even if you aren’t familiar with all the choices.

**Passage-based reading**: You will be given several passages throughout the course of SAT Reading, some short and some long.  Some may be easy to read; others might be dense and filled with unknown terminology.  Each passage will be followed by questions about the passage.

#Content Overview

The passages on SAT reading cover a wide variety of topics, some expository (non-fiction) and some fiction.  Become familiar with strategies to deal with both expository and fiction passages, since they are typically structured differently.  Some of the comprehension concepts you will be tested on include Main Idea, Inference, Vocabulary in Context, Application, Function, and Logical Reasoning.  The sentence completion questions will test your vocabulary knowledge.  Some words will be familiar, while others you may have never heard of in your life.  Studying vocabulary word lists is one way to go about improving vocabulary, but with so many words out there, it’s probably not the most effective.  Reading extensively over a long period of time is the best way to build vocabulary, since hearing a new word in context makes the word more memorable.
